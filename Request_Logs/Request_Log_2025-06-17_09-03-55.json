This component will be added to or subtracted from other horizontal forces (like friction) to determine the net horizontal force. The key assumptions are that the angle (30 degrees) is measured relative to the horizontal, and that standard trigonometric functions (cosine for the adjacent component) are used with the angle in degrees."

This upward component will reduce the effective downward force on the surface, thereby reducing the normal force. This step is crucial for accurately calculating the normal force.

If F_y >= W, the block would lift off the surface, meaning the normal force (N) would be zero, and subsequently, the friction force would also be zero. This would change the problem significantly (e.g., to projectile motion or purely vertical acceleration). This check ensures the fundamental assumption of the block remaining on the surface is valid. The assumption is that if F_y < W, the block remains in contact with the surface."

In the vertical direction, assuming no vertical acceleration (i.e., the block stays on the surface), the sum of vertical forces is zero (Newton's First Law). Therefore, N + F_y - W = 0, which yields N = W - F_y. This calculation is vital because the kinetic friction force is directly proportional to the normal force. The primary assumption is that there is no vertical acceleration of the block, meaning it is not lifting off or sinking into the surface."

This is a resistive force that reduces the net horizontal force. The core assumption here is that the block is *in motion* (or about to move), thus kinetic friction is the relevant type, not static friction. If the problem only provides \u03bc_k, it implies motion is occurring or will occur. We also assume the standard Coulomb friction model where friction is independent of contact area or sliding speed."

In the horizontal direction, the net force (\u03a3F_x) is the difference between the horizontal component of the applied force (F_x) and the kinetic friction force (f_k), i.e., \u03a3F_x = F_x - f_k. This step requires the results from previous force calculations. An implicit assumption is that F_x is greater than f_k, leading to a net force in the direction of the pull, which results in positive acceleration. If F_x were less than or equal to f_k, and the block started from rest, its acceleration would be zero. If it were already moving, it would decelerate or stop."

The assumption is that the mass of the block remains constant throughout the motion and that all relevant forces have been accounted for in the net force calculation."
